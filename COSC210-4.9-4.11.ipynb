    "4.11 (Guess-the-Number Modification) Modify the previous exercise to count the number of guesses the player makes. If the number is 10 or fewer, display \"Either you know the secret or you got lucky!\" If the player makes more than 10 guesses, display \"You should be able to do better!\" Why should it take no more than 10 guesses? Well, with each “good guess,” the player should be able to eliminate half of the numbers, then half of the remaining numbers, and so on. Doing this 10 times narrows down the possibilities to a single number. This kind of “halving” appears in many computer science applications. For example, in the “Computer Science Thinking: Recursion, Searching, Sorting and Big O” chapter, we’ll present the high-speed binary search and merge sort algorithms, and you’ll attempt the quicksort exercise—each of these cleverly uses halving to achieve high performance."
